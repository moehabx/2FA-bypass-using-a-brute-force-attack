This repository contains my solution for the **PortSwigger "2FA broken logic" lab**.

Instead of relying on **Burp Suite‚Äôs Intruder** or **Macros** (which are powerful but often very slow for large brute force ranges especially if you don't have the professional edition), I crafted a **custom Python script** that performs the brute force efficiently using concurrency.

## üìö Lab Description

The target web application implements a **two-factor authentication (2FA)** mechanism:

1. The attacker first logs in with username and password.
2. They are then asked to enter a 4-digit one-time authentication code (0000-9999).
3. The server **does not lock accounts** and allows unlimited attempts, but resets the flow after two wrong codes if done manually.

### Vulnerability

* Lack of proper brute force protections.
* The workflow can be abused by automating re-logins and re-submitting the MFA step for every possible 4-digit code.

## üöÄ My Approach

I saved the requests and created the script of them

creating the Script

to solve this lab using my script only you need to select the target
open the script in a text editor write your lab's url instead of mine

1 install the dependencies first
2 open the script in a text editor write your lab's url instead of mine (edit the target)
3 then python mfa_bruteforce.py


Instead of:

* **Burp Intruder:** Very slow for 10,000 payloads.
* **Burp Macros:** Work, but are clunky and limited in parallelization.

I built a **Python brute force script** using:

* [`requests`](https://docs.python-requests.org/) ‚Äì to manage sessions.
* [`BeautifulSoup`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) ‚Äì to extract CSRF tokens dynamically.
* [`concurrent.futures`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) ‚Äì to run concurrent login attempts and speed up testing.

This script simulates the full login flow for each code until the correct one is found (detected via `302 Found` redirect).

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage



```bash
git clone https:/moehabx/github.com//portswigger-2fa-bruteforce.git
cd portswigger-2fa-bruteforce
pip install -r requirements.txt

python mfa_bruteforce.py
```

### Configurable Settings inside `mfa_bruteforce.py`:

```python
TARGET = "https://<your-lab>.web-security-academy.net"
USERNAME = "carlos"
PASSWORD = "montoya"
MAX_WORKERS = 30    # threads for concurrency
```

## ‚ö° Example Run
we run and found the correct code that sents back the cookie

```
Target: https://0a5a00b5047ee854809c7688004000f5.web-security-academy.net | username: carlos | concurrency: 30

[0000] tried... (info: status 200)
[0100] tried... (info: status 200)
...

[+] SUCCESS! code = 1234 | 302 Found -> /my-account
[+] Set-Cookie: session=AbCdEf123456789; Secure; HttpOnly

Found code: 1234 (details: redirected to /my-account) in 12.3s
Valid Cookie: session=AbCdEf123456789; Secure; HttpOnly
```

we replace our cookie with the found cookie
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot_2025-08-27_23_16_46" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c876f809-9896-4621-b0f2-44303587d69f" />

now we go back to the main page and go to my account 
boom we got carlos's account
